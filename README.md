# Homework5
The source of my code comes from this website https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/. I created the WNBA.csv file by creating a google sheets file and manually copy pasting data from the totals table for the teams of Washington Mystics, Dallas Wings, and LA sparks. Here are the websites of the three teams

https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/teams/DAL/2024.html#all_roster
https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/teams/LAS/2024.html#all_roster

The table has the variables of age, games, games started, minutes played, field goals, field goal attempts, field goal percentage, 3 pointers, 3 point attempts, 3 point percentage, 2 pointers, 2 point attempts, 2 point percentage, free throws, free throw attempts, free throw percentage, offenive rebounds, defensive rebounds, total rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, personal fouls, and points. 

My first graph is a histogram of the total three pointers made by players across the 3 teams above. 
The second graph is a dot plot that shows the relationship between minutes played and total rebounds. One random player was selected and her point is highlighted red, has her name on it, and has a unique design. 

It is important to note that you don't need rvest, dyplr, or ggplot packages due to me not using it. I manually scraped it instead of using R code to scrape. Download the csv file with all the data and the Homework5.R file. Run it and you should get the results that I have posted in my two images. 

Here is the google sheets of the WNBA data in case you prefer looking at that over a csv file.
